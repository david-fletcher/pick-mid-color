-- In this file, we receive a reference to the table plugin.preferences (from ./plugin.lua).
-- In Lua, when a parameter is a table, it is passed by reference.
-- This allows us to mutate the parameter, and the original object will be mutated as well;
-- Thus, we do not need to have a "return value" from this script
-----------------------------------
-- If you need to stage edits to the preferences table, but don't want them saved in certain situations,
-- consider creating a deep copy of the preferences table at the start of your script,
-- editing the copy, and if you'd like to save your changes, deep copy the edited copy you made, and
-- save it back to the original preferences table; an implementation of a deep copy function
-- can be found in ./helpers.lua
